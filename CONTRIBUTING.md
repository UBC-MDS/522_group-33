# Contributing to 522-Group 33

We welcome all contributions to this project! If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please open up an issue [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/522_group-33/issues). If you'd like to contribute a feature or bug fix, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request. We will review pull requests within 7 days. For more info, please read below.

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), 
for documentation.  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.
