## Summary

For this analysis, we conduct the {neutral network Multi-layer Perception (MLP) model} in order to try to predict the different wine quality based on the wine attributes obtained from various physicochemical tests such as alcohol, sulfur diocide, fixed acidity, residual sugar. The results showed that {MPL yield robust results} with 80% accuracy and 80% f1- score (i.e.  a weighted average metric of the precision and recall) on validation set. When we run the model on our test set, we also have comparably high score at 80% accuracu and f1-score. However, it incorrectly predicts {XX cases from normal wine to be excellent wine - talk about confusion matrix}. 

As the rate of misclassification is not high and the impact can be corrected in further assessment, we believe this model could decent serve its purpose as a wine predictor to conduct first-cut wine classification, which could help speed up the wink ratings process. 

## Introduction

Traditional methods of categorizing wine are prone to human error and can vary drastically from expert to expert. We propose a data mining approach to predict wine quality using machine learning techniques for classification problems. The resulting model, we hope, could serve as as one of scientific and systematic ways to classify wine, which is a springboard for further research in personalized wine recommendation, quality assessment and comparison unit. 

Moreover, we believe wineries or wine rating institutes could find the model as a useful and reliable first-cut wine quality test before further expert's assessment. This could lead to a more cost and time-effective wine screening process, and subsequently facilitate more effective and efficient business decisions and strategies.
	

## Methods

### Data

The data set used in this project is the results of a chemical analysis of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, conducted by Paulo Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis [@cortez2009modeling]. It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@Dua:2019] which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).

There are two datasets for red and white wine samples. For each wine sample observation , the inputs contains measurements of various objective physicochemical tests, and the output is the median wine quality ratings given by experts on the scale from 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).The author notes that data on grape types, wine brand, wind selling price among other are not available due to privacy and logistics issues. There are 1599 observations for red wine and 4898 observations of white wine.  


### Analysis

At the preprocessing stage, we decided to combine the red and white data set as well as group the data in bigger classification, namely "poor", "normal" and "excellent" for scale "1-4", "5-6" and "7-9" so as to  have bigger sample size. We acknowledge that the data is imbalanced, hence instead of only using accuracy based to judge the model performance, we also include f1-score and use it as our main assessment metric. f-1 score is metric that combine both the precision and recall metrics, which focus on the false negative and false positive rate of the data and would be appropriate to use with an imbalanced data set.

In this project we are trying to predict the quality of a given wine sample using wine attributes obtained from various physicochemical tests. Based on our literary review, we found that researchers from Karadeniz Technical Univeristy used Random Forest Algorithm had also tried to classify between red wine and white wine for the same dataset [@er2016classification]. They further used 3 different data mining algorithms namely k-nearest-neighbourhood random forests and support vector machine learning to classify the quality of both red wine and white wine. This motivate us to proceed with to use cross-validation to select the best model for our analysis.

We eventually decided to pick {neutral network Multi-layer Perception (MLP) model as the model that yield the best after running the various machine learning model through the train dataset and comparing their performance based on f1-score}


The Python and R programming languages [@R; @Python] and the following Python and R packages were used to perform the analysis: scikit-learn [@scikit-learn], docoptpython [@docoptpython], docopt [@docopt], altair [@altair], vega-lite [@vega-lite], IPython-ipykernel [@IPython], matplotlib [@matplotlib], scipy [@SciPy], numpy [@harris2020array], pandas [@pandas], graphviz [@graphviz], pandas-profiling [@pandasprofiling2019],  knitr [@knitr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], kableExtra [@kableExtra].

## Results & Discussion

Looking at the distribution plot of the respective wine quality group interacting with each explanatory features, we can see that higher quality wine seems to be more associated with higher `alcohol` level and lower `density`. Lower `volatile acidity` also seems to be indicative of better wine. Better ranked wine also seem to have `higher free sulfur dioxide` level than poor wine though the relationship is not that clear based on the plot. The rest of the features do not seems be very distinguishable among different quality wine.

We plan to build a predictive classification model to provide the standardized metric discussed above. In order for the model to abide by the golden rule, we plan to split the data into train and test sets (80%-20% respectively) and perform exploratory data analysis in order to assess any class imbalance, outliers that needs to be considered when scouting for best model to fit our needs. After the EDA, we see that wine quality ranking seems to be more likely to associate with alcohol, density, free sulfur dioxide, volatile acidity, wine type than the rest of the input features. Hence a multiclass linear classification could be appropriate to estimate the impact each features have on wine quality ranking.
	
The outcome or the Standardized metric we are trying to establish is to classify all wines into three classes (Poor, Normal, Excellent). One likely model suitable for this classification is linear regression and set a threshold for each class in the predicted probabilities. Since our data set is reasonably sized with 1598 observations, we can choose a higher cross-validation of ~50 folds. We will use this accuracy to tune our model for the best fit. After doing so, we re-fit the model on the entire training data set, and then evaluate itâ€™s performance on the test data set. This gives a deeper understanding of our model. We will use this information to address classification errors and report them as a table in the final report.}



Having said that the research also need further improvement in terms of obtaining a more balanced data set for training and cross-validation. More feature engineer and selection could be conducted to minimize the affect of correlation among the explanatory variable. Furthermore, in order to assess the robustness of the predicting model, we need to test the model with deployment data in real world besides testing with our test data.
